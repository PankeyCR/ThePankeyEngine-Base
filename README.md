# ThePankeyEngine-Base

**ThePankeyEngine-Base** is the foundation of the Pankey Engine.  
It provides **low-level data structures, state management, logging, and string utilities** designed to work across all platforms â€” from microcontrollers to desktop systems.

Other Pankey Engine libraries will be built on top of this one, making this the **core dependency** for the entire ecosystem.
